      What is Campus Travelr?
    </li>
    <p>
      Campus Travelr is a new business focused on getting rid of getting lost on
      campus or not being able to find a parking spot. We were founded in March
      2016 with the purpose of fixing navigation and parking problems at
      UAlbany. We will soon be coming out with apps and technologies that will
      hopefully be implemented at the university soon.

      What makes you different from your competitors?
    </li>
    <p>
      The main difference between us and our competitors is that we are completely
      Free and Open Source. All of our source code will be available online on
      our website and on Github and Gitlab. We will also be significantly cheaper
      and be better about privacy and security of our users data and sensitive
      information.
